</table><h4 id="identifying-a-problem">1. Identifying a problem</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every decision starts with a <mark>problem</mark>, a <mark>discrepancy</mark> between <mark>an existing and a desired</mark> condition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managers also have to be cautious <strong>not</strong> to confuse <mark>problems</mark> with <mark>symptoms of a problem</mark></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identify-decision-criteria">2. Identify Decision Criteria</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once one identified a problem, they must <mark>identify the criteria</mark> important or relevant to the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most decision makers have criteria guiding their decision even if not explicitly stated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="allocate-weights-to-criteria">3. Allocate weights to Criteria</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the relevant criteria aren’t equally important, the decision maker must <mark>weight the items in order</mark> to give them the correct priority in the decision.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="develop-alternatives">4. Develop Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decision makers list the <mark>viable alternatives</mark> to solve the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alternatives are <mark>only listed—not evaluated</mark></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analyse-alternatives">5. Analyse Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After listing data, the decision maker must <mark>evaluate</mark> them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you multiply each alternative by alternative weight, you get a <mark>weighted alternative</mark></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="select-an-alternative">6. Select an alternative</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choosing either <mark>the best alternative</mark> or <mark>the one with the highest total</mark> in step 5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that <mark>the alternative that’s best according to the numbers may <strong>not</strong> be the best alternative</mark> due to having incorrect weights.\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, if one find that the alternative is “not right”, the decision maker need to decide if a review of criteria is needed before implementing the alternative</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="implement-the-alternative">7. Implement the alternative</h4>
<ul>
<li><mark>Conveying the decision to those affected by the decision</mark> and <mark>getting their commitment to it</mark></li>

<h4 id="evaluate-decision-effectiveness">8. Evaluate Decision Effectiveness</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluating the outcome and/or result of the experiment to <mark>see if the problem is resolved</mark>. If the problem still exists, then managers need to see what’s wrong:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some suggested questions (from the textbook):</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the problem incorrectly defined?</li>
<li>Were errors made when evaluating alternatives?</li>
<li>Was the right alternative selected but poorly implemented?</li>

<ol>
<li><mark>Provides direction</mark>: letting employees and people know what their organization is trying to achieve and contribute to such goals.</li>
<li><mark>Reduces uncertainty</mark>: forcing managers to look ahead, anticipate and consider the impact of change, as well as develop responses. <mark>Planning won’t eliminate uncertainty, but managers plan to respond effectively</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>Minimizes waste and uncertainty</mark>: Work coordinates around plan, therefore reducing inefficiencies and mistakes can be corrected.</li>
<li><mark>Establishes <strong>goals</strong> or <strong>standard</strong> uses in controlling</mark>: When control, managers see when the plan has been carried out. Without plans, there would be no measure of work effort</li>

<ul>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Backward vertical integration</mark> is when an organization <mark>becomes its own supplier to control its inputs</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>A <mark>turnaround strategy</mark> is a strategy used when problems are <mark>more serious</mark>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Managers do 2 things for both strategies: <mark>cutting costs</mark> and <mark>restrucring organizational operations</mark>. However, turnaround strategies involves more extensive use of those strategies rather than a retrenchment strategy</p>
<h2 id="competitive-stratgies-porter">Competitive stratgies (Porter)</h2>
<h3 id="preface-1">Preface</h3>
<p>In any industry, managers face <mark>5 threats</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>Threat of new entrants</mark>. Factors such as economies of scale, brand loyalty, and capital requirements determine how easy or hard it is for new competitors to enter an industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Threat of substitutes</mark>. Factors such as switching costs and buyer loyalty determine the degree to which customers are likely to buy a substitute product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Bargaining power of buyers</mark>. Factors such as number of customers in the market, customer information, and the availability of substitutes determine the amount of influence that buyers have in an industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Bargaining power of suppliers</mark>. Factors such as the degree of supplier concentration and availability of substitute inputs determine the amount of power that suppliers have over firms in the industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Current rivalry</mark>. Factors such as industry growth rate, increasing or falling demand, and product differences determine how intense the competitive rivalry will be among firms currently in the industry.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-competitive-strategy">Choosing a competitive strategy</h3>
<p>Porter suggests that strategies can be used to give the organization a <mark>competitive advantage</mark>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <mark>cost leadership strategy</mark> is a strategy in which the organization sets to become the lowest cost producer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overhead is kept to a minimum, and <mark>the firm does everything it can to cut costs</mark>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <mark>differentiation strategy</mark> is a strategy in which a company seeks to offer <mark>unique products that are widely valued by customers</mark>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The key to this strategy is that <mark>the product or service chosen must set the firm apart</mark>, and <mark>be significant enough to justify a price premium that exceeds the cost of differentiating</mark>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <mark>focus strategy</mark> is a strategy in which a business pursues a <mark>cost or differentation advantage</mark> in a <mark>narrow  industry segment</mark>.</p>
<ul>

<p>Most large organizations continue to use combinations of most or all types of departmentalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One popular trend of departmentalization is the <mark>increasing use of <strong>customer</strong> departmentalization</mark>, since they are important to a business. Another trend is the use of <mark>teams</mark>, one specific type of which is a <mark>cross-functional team</mark>, a team of individuals from various functional specialities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chain-of-command.">Chain of Command.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <mark>chain of command</mark> is a continuous line of authority that extends from <mark>upper levels of organization to the lower levels</mark> and <mark>clarifies who reports to whom</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chain of command needs three important concepts: <mark>authority, responsibility and unity of command</mark></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="authority">Authority</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>Authority</mark> refers to the <mark>rights inherent in a mangerial position</mark>. Managers had authority to coordinate and oversee the work of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Early writers</mark> assumed that <mark>rights and power are the sole source of influence and that if an order were given, it would be obeyed.</mark> They distinguished two forms of authority: <mark>line authority</mark> and <mark>staff authority</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Line theory</mark> entitles a manager to <mark>direct the work of an employee</mark></li>
<li><mark>Staff theory</mark> is the authority that have been created to <mark>support, assist and advise</mark> those holding <mark>line authority</mark>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Chester Barnard</mark> proposed the <mark>accpetance theory of authority</mark>, stating that <mark>authority does not come from the manager</mark> but from the <mark>willingness to accept it by subordinates</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He contended that subordinates will accept orders <mark>only if</mark> the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>They <mark>understand the order</mark></li>
<li>They feel the order is <mark>consistent</mark> with the <mark>purpose</mark> of the organization</li>
<li>The order <mark>does <strong>NOT</strong> conflict</mark> with their <mark>personal beliefs</mark></li>
<li>They are <mark>able to perform the task as directed</mark> .</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>Responsibility</mark> is the <mark>obligation or expectation</mark> to <mark>perform assigned duties</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Assigning work authority without responsibility and accountability</mark> can create opportunities for abuse, and <mark>none should be accountable for things that they had no authority for</mark>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unity-of-command">Unity of command</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <mark>unity of command</mark> states that <mark>one person <strong>ONLY</strong> reports to one manager</mark>. Conflicting demands from bosses when otherwise can cuase problems</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todays-view-2">Today’s view</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While the elements were believed to be essential, they are far less important today, such as by the use of Information Technology, allowing employees to access information only available to managers, or communicate without the chain of commands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may find themselves reporting to more than one boss, violating the unity of command principle, but it can work if communication, conflict, etc are well-managed by involved parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="span-of-control">Span of control</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <mark>span of control</mark> is defined as the ==number of employees == a manager <mark>can effectively and efficiently manage</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The traditional view: <mark>managers couldn’t and shouldn’t manage more than 5-6 employees</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wider the span, the more successful the organization if all things being equal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when <mark>the span becomes too large</mark>, employee performance will suffer because <mark>managers may no longer have the time to provide the necessary leadership and support</mark>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="todays-view-3">Today’s view</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>Many factors</mark> influence the number of employees a manager can efficiently and effectively manage, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <mark>skills and abilities</mark> of the manager</li>
<li>The <mark>characteristics of the work</mark> being done</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trend in recent years has been towards larger spans of control, with is consistent with managers’ efforts to speed up decision making, increase flexibility, get closer to customers, empower employees, and reduce costs. They also recognize that they can handle a wider span when employees know their jobs well and when they understand organizational processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="centralization-and-decentralization">Centralization and Decentralization</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>Centralization</mark> is the <mark>degree to which decision making takes place at the upper level</mark> of the organization,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Decentralization</mark> is the reverse, <mark>the degree of which decision is made by lower-level employees</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early writers prposed that the degree of centralization depended on the situation, but today organizations were much more complex and responsive to dynamic changes in their problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-fielder-model-fm">The Fielder Model (FM)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><mark>The Fiedler Model</mark> proposed that ==effective group management depended on <mark>the proper match of the leader’s style</mark> and <mark>the amount of control and influence in the situation</mark>. It is based on the premise that <mark>a certain leadership style</mark> would be <mark>most effective in different situations</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key to this model would be to <mark>define the leadership styles and the situations</mark> and <mark>identify the appropiate combinations of style and situation</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiedler proposed that a <mark>key factor in leadership success</mark> was an individual’s <mark>basic leadership style</mark>, either <mark>task oriented</mark> or <mark>relationship oriented</mark>. To measure the style, he developed the <mark>least-preferred co-worker (LPC) questionnaire</mark>, consisting of 18 pairs of contrasting adjectives. If the leader described the least-preferred co-worker in <mark>positive terms (or high LPC score)</mark> then they are considered to have good relationship with others, and is therefore <mark>relationship oriented</mark>, and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the leadership style had been assessed through the LPC, the situation needs to be evaluated in order to match the leader. Fiedler’s research identified <mark>three contingency dimensions</mark> that defined the <mark>key situational factors</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Leader-member</mark> relations: The <mark>degree of trust, confidence, and respect</mark> employees have for their leader, rated as <mark>good or poor</mark></li>
<li><mark>Task structure</mark>: The <mark>degree to which job assignments were formalized and structured</mark>, rated as <mark>high or low</mark></li>
<li><mark>Position power</mark>: the <mark>degree of influence a leader had over activities</mark> such hiring, discipline, promotions, and salary increases, rated as <mark>strong or weak</mark></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each situation was evaluated in these 3 variables, when combined produced 8 situations that are either favorable or unfavorable for the leader. Fiedler concluded that <mark>task-oriented leaders performed better</mark> in <mark>very favourable situations <strong>and</strong> in very unfavourable situations</mark>, while <mark>relationship-oriented leaders performed better in moderately favourable situations</mark>.</p>

<h3 id="situational-leadership-theory-slt">Situational Leadership Theory (SLT)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developed by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard, the <mark>Situational Leadership Theory (SLT)</mark> is a contingency theory that focuses on the <mark>followers’ readiness</mark>. The theory reflects the idea that <mark>it’s the followers who accept or reject the leader, and effectiveness of the group depended on them</mark>, which is an important dimension that other theories overlooked or under-emphasized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hersey and Blanchard defined <mark>readiness</mark> as <mark>the extent to which people have the ability and willingness to accomplish a specific task</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SLT uses the <mark>same two leadership dimension as FM</mark>: <mark>task</mark> and <mark>relationship behaviors</mark>. However, it also considers each as high or low and combine into <mark>four distinct styles</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Telling (high task–low relationship)</mark>: The leader <mark>defines roles</mark> and <mark>tells people what, how, when, and where to do various tasks</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>Selling (high task–high relationship)</mark>—The leader <mark>provides both directive and supportive behaviour</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>Participating (low task–high relationship)</mark>—The <mark>leader and followers share in decision making</mark>; the <mark>main role of the leader</mark> is <mark>facilitating and communicating</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>Delegating (low task–low relationship)</mark>—The leader <mark>provides little direction or support.</mark></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final component of SLT is the <mark>four stages of follower readiness</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>R1</mark>—People are <mark>both unable and unwilling</mark> to take responsibility for doing something. Followers <mark>aren’t competent or confident</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>R2</mark>—People are <mark>unable but willing</mark> to do the necessary job tasks. Followers are <mark>motivated but lack the appropriate skills</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>R3</mark>—People are <mark>able but unwilling</mark> to do what the leader wants. Followers are <mark>competent but don’t want to do something</mark>.</li>
<li><mark>R4</mark>—People are both <mark>able and willing</mark> to do what is asked of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As followers reach <mark>higher levels of readiness</mark>, the leader responds not only by <mark>decreasing control over their activities</mark> but also by <mark>decreasing relationship behaviours.</mark></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>House identified <mark>four leadership behaviors</mark>:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Directive leader</mark>: The leader lets subordinates know what’s expected of them, schedules work to be done, and gives specific guidance on how to accomplish tasks.</li>
<li><mark>Supportive leader</mark>: The leader shows concern for the needs of followers and is friendly.</li>
<li><mark>Participative leader</mark>: —The leader consults with group members and uses their suggestions before making a decision.</li>
<li><mark>Achievement-oriented leader</mark>: —The leader sets challenging goals and expects followers to perform at their highest level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <mark>contrast</mark> to <mark>Fiedler’s view that a leader can’t change his or her behaviour</mark>, House assumed that <mark>leaders are flexible and can display any or all of these leadership styles, depending on the situation.</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PGT proposes two situational or contingency variables that moderate the leadership behaviour-outcome relationship: <mark>the environment</mark> outside control of the  follower, and those that are part of the personal characteristics of the <mark>follower</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Environmental factors</mark> determine the <mark>type of leader behaviour required</mark> if <mark>subordinate outcomes are to be maximized</mark>; <mark>personal characteristics of the follower</mark> determine <mark>how the environment and leader behaviour are interpreted</mark>.</p>

<li>
<p>Developed by <mark>J. Stacey Adams</mark>, <mark>equity theory</mark> proposes that employees perceive <mark>what they get</mark> from a job situation (<mark>outcomes</mark>) in relation to <mark>what they put in</mark> (<mark>inputs</mark>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an employee perceives <mark>their ratio to be equal to relevant others</mark>, a state of <mark>equity</mark> exists. Otherwise, <mark>inequity</mark> exists and they view themselves as <mark>under-rewarded</mark> or <mark>over-rewarded</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Not all (in)equity is real</mark>, it’s the <mark>perception</mark> that determines it. When inequity happens, employees may act on it, which results in <mark>lower or higher productivity</mark>, <mark>improved or reduced quality of output</mark>, <mark>increased absenteeism</mark>, or <mark>voluntary resignation</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <mark>referent</mark>, the <mark>other people (friends, coworkers, etc), systems (pay policies, procedures, allocation), selves (input-output ratios unique to the individual), etc. that individuals compare themselves to</mark> is an important concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark>Historically</mark>, equity theory focused on <mark>distributive justice</mark>, the <mark>perceived fairness</mark> of the <mark>amount and allocation rewards</mark> of individuals. ==Current research ==looks into <mark>procedural justice</mark>, which is the <mark>perceived fairness</mark> of the <mark>process used to determine the distribution of rewards</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research showed that <mark>distributive justice has a greater influence on employee satisfaction than procedural justice</mark>, while <mark>procedural justice tends to affect an employee’s organizational commitment, trust in his or her manager, and intention to quit.</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managers should <mark>openly sharing information on how allocation decisions are made</mark>, <mark>follow consistent and unbiased procedures</mark>, and engage in similar practices to increase the perception of procedural justice. Employees will be more likely to view the manager in a positive light even if they are dissatisfied with other outcomes.</p>

<li>
<p>The <mark>most comprehensive</mark> and <mark>widely accepted</mark> theory, <mark>expectancy theory</mark> by <mark>Victor Vroom</mark> said that <mark>individuals act in certain ways based on the <strong>expectation</strong> that the act will followed by a given outcome <strong>and</strong> on the attractiveness of such outcome to the individual.</mark></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The explaination can be summed up in three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>How hard do I have to work</mark> to achieve a certain level of performance, and <mark>can I</mark> actually achieve that level?</li>
<li><mark>What reward</mark> will I get for working at that level of performance?</li>
<li><mark>How attractive is the reward</mark> to me, and <mark>does it help me</mark> achieve my goals?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key to Expectancy Theory is to understand the individual’s <mark>goal</mark> and the <mark>link between effort - performance - rewards - individual goal satisfaction</mark>, and stresses that managers need to understand why <mark>employees view certain outcomes as  (un)attractive</mark>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory only concerns about <mark>perceptions</mark>, <mark>reality is irrelevant</mark>. An individual’s own <mark><strong>perceptions</strong> of performance, reward, and goal outcomes, <strong>not the outcomes</strong> themselves will determine their motivation</mark>.</p>
